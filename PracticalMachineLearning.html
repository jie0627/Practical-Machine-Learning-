Practical Machine Learning Course Project
==========================================

I load caret and randomForest package.
 ```{r}
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
 ```

I load the data in R (including both training and test data sets).
 ```{r}
 training = read.csv("pml-training.csv", header = TRUE)
 testing = read.csv("pml-testing.csv", header = TRUE)
 ```
 
I look up columns with a high percent of data that is either NA or "", remove entire NA columns, and apply it to data frames.
```{r}
#Remove columns with more than the treshold of NA or "" values
Columns1 <- !apply(training, 2, function(x) sum(is.na(x)) > treshold  || sum(x=="") > treshold)
training <- training[, Columns1]
```
