 Introduction
---------------------------------
 I use the random forest method to estimate features for the Human Activity Recognition data set from Groupware. 

 Data
---------------------------------
 I loaded caret package, then the data in R.
 
 I loaded the  training and test data sets
 ```{r}
 training = read.csv("pml-training.csv", header = TRUE)
 testing = read.csv("pml-testing.csv", header = TRUE)
 ```
 
I checked for columns with a high percent of data that is either NA or "", and  remove entire NA columns, and apply it to data frames.
